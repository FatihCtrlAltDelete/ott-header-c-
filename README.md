# ott-header-c++
A C++ header
===================
The C++ ott header is a C++ header created for programmers who are lazy about writing cout, endl, cin, etc. by using this header you can abbreviate std::cout, etc. with the functions in the header file. But if you are new or currently learning C++ then don't use this header because this header is made for people who already understand basic or advanced C++.

In this repository there is an "ott" file which already uses "#include <iostream>" and "using namespace std;", but for those of you who don't like using the namespace std; You can use the ottwnm or ottxnm file which uses the ott namespace

USE IT WISELY!!!
